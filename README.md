## N.B. 
* Inspiration: I missed my name day last time because I forgot to check twitter, and I don't like missing out on free pizza üçï
* I have this script set to run on a cron schedule on my raspberry pi, but the AWS lambda free tier would be another viable option for running on a defined schedule 
* It may not be pretty, but it works üòä
